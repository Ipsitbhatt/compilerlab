I read about what he will speak about, eg Turkey. The latter is very unstable, several politicians currently in gov and outside have been making bold declarations against Greek sovereignty derived by the 1923 Lausanne Treaty. Albania under Turkish influence has ripped up the naval border agreement with Greece and FYROMacedonia continues to propagate land claims over Greece in its constitution. US foreign policy has sadly favoured all adversaries of Greece. With Greece practically bankrupt, Troika still in control and Nato patrolling the Aegean for refugees, the situation is not ideal. That Obama chooses to visit is very curious to me. Their influence over IMF and Merkel regarding the debt and its forgiveness (not real forgiveness but a vehicle to manage it to allow some growth) is said to be Obama's 'gift' A lot will be said about the visit, (he will also visit the island of Lesbos) this week, it is an opportunity to tweet WL's most recent release about Greece and Cables full of the various national security problems described in them including Cyprus.",

This release will be revisited for many months to come, and as the different parts of the release go ahead interest will fluctuate but progressively increase, so plan B (old fashion technology for a back up recording of the press conference not a bad idea) JA is right that tech co's and tech journals/journalists reporting on the matter tend to ignore the political aspect of the issue, and so the analysis provided by WL during the press conference, bringing everything together (technical, political, geopolitical, legal) it is of great value in sparking discussions. Also, perhaps consider, at a time when the release is a bit further down, a round table discussion post publication with small number of ppl reviewing the releases so far, not live (no avoid interference), pre-recorded but with the possibility of going over the material and reviewing its impact (Brexit Club style but only 30-60 min long) of course it is easy for me to say... anyways we continue to be amazed at WL efforts to prevail no matter what so keep it up <3",

In other articles notes that US interest has been up till now limited and focused on Greece's Souda bay with developing US Naval facilities in Crete, now the focus will include other islands too, mentions Turkey's unreliability as a partner for a reason, but of course I see an increased US military presence in the Aegean as strategically controlling the straights into Black see and the Russian fleet stationed there, perhaps limiting its involvement in Syria in support of Assad. Reminder that Nato has already been deployed in the Aegean 'to control refugee flows from Turkey' albeit obliged Turkey with avoiding South East part as Turkey claims should be de-militarised due to Lozane treatie and other accords (Greece has militarised parts of the aegean since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus).

Whether they intended to carry it out or they just did it to intimidate, we don't know but it worked, he resigned after only 2 years in government. The following government of the 'centre left' PASOK headed by Clinton's friend George Papandreou brought the Troika and IMF in spectacularly failing to manage the crisis and he resigned also after 2 years to hand over to a buraucratic coallition gov that lasted 9 months or so, then the right wing party of New Democracy headed by Samaras got elected, ex housemate of George Papandreou in US when they were both studying there, who also governed 2 and a half years till Syriza was elected in January 2015, then we had the 'No' referendum, then elections again in Sep 2015. Why I am saying all this? Yes the crisis and effective bankrupsy was the primary reason of the political instability but the complete failure of the political world to deal with the crisis, the rise of the Golden Dawn, points to an assault on democratic sovereignty that its beginning lies in US deep state destabilisation efforts during the Karamanlis government, first with the scandal of the unlawful interception of at least 150 people in government politics and the economy and then planning 'Pythia', at least as an assassination threat on Karamanlis if not the actual thing. With a country like Greece with fresh memories of brutal repression (Junta 67-74) etc etc, introducing such destabilisation is crippling to the political world as they do not have confidence they can actually govern the country. They did it with impunity to Greece why they won't do it to America? Perhaps they always did it but were not found out, now everyone can see (not the details of it) but it is so obvious CIA and the rest of them meddle.",

I guess someone else put Agee in there in the speech as a WikiLeaks/whistleblower equivalent from the past, from during the cold war when the trenches were clear cut and deep.

It was not actually said as such but this is how it remains in history... as a 'no you cannot pass your armies into Greece through the Albanian border Mussolini, we shall fight'. Together with the slight distortion of history (the word 'no' never was said, although Greece did not acquiesce to the Italian army advance and fought) most Greeks forget that Metaxas, the politician in charge of Greece at the time was a brutal dictator. He was a confirmed fascist who propagated everything that Mussolini and Hitler propagated albeit in a ancient Greek toga intellectual 'garment'. Assad equally is a political dictator albeit considering the plurality of religions and nations within Syria, he is also the 'tribal chief' of the Allawites. Forgive me I am hardly an expert in matters Syrian but there is no doubt in my mind the Greeks would rather have Metaxa the dictator than Mussolini the dictator. I think most people can understand why. Mussolini too had a plan to split Greece into parts and in fact during the 4 years of occupation Greece was split into three parts The Italian, The German, The Bulgarian. Out of all three the Bulgarian was considered the most barbaric as ethnic cleansing was part of the agenda to truly expand Bulgaria giving it access into the Aegean. The current problems between Greece and FYROM or Macedonia over the name stem from that period of Bulgarian occupation when the occupiers (Bulgarians) to consolidate their rule and cement it for the future created the 'greater Macedonia' claiming it as a separate state, nation, in fact, and starting to manufacture the historic revisionism so helpful in propaganda. If the occupation had lasted longer than 4 years the map of Greece would today be very different. FYROM to this day includes in its national constitution a commitment to 'liberate' those historic lands that are currently under foreign control... all this referring to 'the Greater Macedonian Myth' created by Bulgarians in the 40's.
